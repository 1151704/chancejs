title: "1.0.0"
diff: 0.8.0...1.0.0
---

* Long overdue version bump. The Chance API has long been stable and should have had major version 1 long ago.
* Added new generators: `file()`, `semver()`, `weekday()`
* Split apart `pick()` into `pickone()` and `pickset()`. The old `pick()` was very confusing, returning one item if no length supplied or an array if a multiple was supplied. Breaking these apart should make things far less confusing. Deprecated `pick()`
* More options for `color()` and `first()` and `last()` and `word()` and `syllable()`
* Bugfixes
