title: "0.6.1"
diff: 0.5.6...0.6.1
---

* Add a bunch of new generators including: altitude(), apple\_token() cpf(), currency(), currency_pair(), depth(), geohash(), get(), mac\_address(), n(), set(), ssn(), unique(), weighted()
* Data now separated and replaceable via set(). Much better for internationalization or cases where the defaults are inadequate.
* New options for:
  * email() - can now specify length of word before @
  * name_prefix() - now can specify gender
* Possibly breaking changes (from 0.5.x):
  * age() - now default age range is far more sensical but this means it is generally lower (default max used to be 120 now only 65)
  * guid() - now returns all lowercase to accord with the majority of uses in the wild
  * states() - now only returns US states by default, territories and armed forces by flag
