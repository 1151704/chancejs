title: seed

You can also instantiate your own instance of Chance with a known seed. This is
useful for creating repeatable results.

{% highlight js %}
var chance1 = new Chance(12345);
var chance2 = new Chance(12345);

console.log(chance1.random());
console.log(chance2.random());
{% endhighlight %}

Since both copies of Chance had the same seed, they will both generate the same
random number sequence each time they're called.

This allows for repeatability, if desired.
