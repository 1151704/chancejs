title: seed

You can also instantiate your own instance of Chance with a known seed. This is
useful for creating repeatable results.

{% highlight js %}
var chance1 = new Chance(12345);
var chance2 = new Chance(12345);

console.log(chance1.random());
console.log(chance2.random());
{% endhighlight %}

Since both copies of Chance had the same seed, they will both generate the same
random number sequence each time they're called.

This allows for repeatability, if desired.

This is possible because **Chance** is built atop a [Mersenne Twister][mersenne],
a pseudo-random number generator which produces repeatable results given the same seed.
