<p class="pullquote" data-pullquote="Wanted to use float or double as the method name but both are JS reserved words" markdown="1"></p>

Return a random floating point number.

{% highlight js %}
chance.floating();
=> -211920142886.5024
{% endhighlight %}

By default it will return a fixed number of at most 4 digits after the decimal.

Note: *at most* 4 digits. This because, unless we returned trailing zeroes
(which aren't allowed on the JavaScript float) we can't guarantee 4 digits after
the decimal. So if random chance comes back with `82383854.2000` then
`82383854.2` is what will be returned.

To retrieve a set number of fixed digits after the decimal, provide it as an option.

{% highlight js %}
chance.floating({fixed: 7});
=> -749512327.7447168
{% endhighlight %}

As with other number functions, can include a min and/or max.

{% highlight js %}
chance.floating({min: 0, max: 100});
=> 31.9021
{% endhighlight %}

Or combine them.

{% highlight js %}
chance.floating({min: 0, max: 100, fixed: 8});
=> 45.92367599
{% endhighlight %}
