Return a random sentence populated by semi-pronounceable random (nonsense) words.

{% highlight js %}
  chance.sentence();
  => 'Witpevze mappos isoletu fo res bi geow pofin mu rupoho revzi utva ne.'
{% endhighlight %}

The sentence starts with a capital letter, and ends with a period.

Default is a sentence with a random number of words from 12 to 18.

*This length is chosen as the default as it works out to the average English
sentence is in that range.*

Optionally specify the number of words in the sentence.

{% highlight js %}
  chance.sentence({words: 5});
  => 'Waddik jeasmov cakgilta ficub up.'
{% endhighlight %}
